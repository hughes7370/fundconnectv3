## Deployment

To deploy the application:

1. Set up a Supabase project with the schema.sql file
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel
4. Deploy the application

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Make changes and test locally
6. Commit changes and push to GitHub
7. Vercel will automatically deploy the changes

## Testing

For the MVP, manual testing should be performed for:

- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control
- Fund uploading and discovery
- Interest expression
- Commission calculation

Automated tests will be added in future iterations.
