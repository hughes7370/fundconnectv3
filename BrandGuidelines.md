### 1. Brand Identity

#### Color Scheme
- **Primary Colors**: Navy blue (#1E3A8A) or deep gray (#4B5563) to convey professionalism, trust, and reliability—staples in fintech branding.
- **Accent Colors**: Teal (#2DD4BF), green (#10B981), or soft gold (#FBBF24) to add a modern touch and differentiate the brand. Green symbolizes growth, teal suggests innovation, and gold hints at value.
- **Neutral Tones**: Light gray (#E5E7EB) and white (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds to maintain a clean, uncluttered look.
- **Usage**: Primary colors dominate headers, buttons, and key UI elements; accent colors highlight CTAs or important data points.

#### Typography
- **Font Family**: Opt for a clean, sans-serif font like **Helvetica**, **Arial**, **Inter**, or **Roboto**. These are highly readable and convey professionalism.
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - **Headings**: Bold weights (e.g., Helvetica Bold) at 24–36px.
  - **Subheadings**: Medium weights at 18–22px.
  - **Body Text**: Regular weights at 14–16px.
- **Special Cases**: Use a monospaced font like **Source Code Pro** for data, numbers, or code snippets in tables or dashboards.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast (e.g., dark text on light backgrounds) and legible font sizes.

#### Visual Style
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Modern and minimalist, prioritizing clarity and functionality. Avoid unnecessary decorations—every element serves a purpose.
- **Illustrations**: Use sparingly for onboarding or explaining complex concepts. Opt for flat or isometric designs in the brand’s color scheme.
- **Photography**: If included, choose high-quality images evoking professionalism (e.g., cityscapes, financial districts, or abstract data visuals). If you need to, you can use the Unsplash API to generate the images needed for the front-end.

  - Add tooltips for complex inputs.
- **Validation**: Real-time feedback with green checkmarks or red error messages (e.g., “Please enter a valid amount”).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure forms are screen-reader compatible with ARIA labels.

- **Consistency**: Apply the same tone across the website, app, and marketing materials.
