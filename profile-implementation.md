# Profile Page Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive profile management system for the Fund Connect platform, focusing on agent profiles. The profile page allows agents to manage their personal information, security settings, professional details, and preferences.

## Components Created

1. **ProfilePage (`/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`)**
   - Main container component with tab navigation
   - Handles data fetching from Supabase
   - Manages state for the active tab

2. **ProfileTabs (`/dashboard/profile/ProfileTabs.tsx`)**
   - Tab navigation component
   - Allows switching between different profile sections

3. **PersonalInfoForm (`/dashboard/profile/PersonalInfoForm.tsx`)**
   - Form for managing personal information
   - Fields: name, email (display only), phone
   - Profile picture upload using Supabase Storage

4. **SecurityForm (`/dashboard/profile/SecurityForm.tsx`)**
   - Form for managing security settings
   - Features: change password, change email

5. **ProfessionalInfoForm (`/dashboard/profile/ProfessionalInfoForm.tsx`)**
   - Form for managing professional details
   - Fields: company/firm, professional title, bio, years of experience, certifications, LinkedIn profile, website

6. **PreferencesForm (`/dashboard/profile/PreferencesForm.tsx`)**
   - Form for managing user preferences
   - Settings: notification preferences, profile visibility

## Database Changes

Created a new `profiles` table in Supabase with the following columns:
- `id`: UUID (primary key, references auth.users)
- Personal info: name, phone, avatar_url
- Professional info: company, title, bio, years_experience, certifications, linkedin_url, website_url
- Preferences: email_notifications, marketing_emails, profile_visibility
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at

Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own profile data.

Created a trigger to automatically create a profile entry when a new user signs up.

Created a storage bucket for profile photos with appropriate RLS policies.

## Features Implemented

1. **Personal Information Management**
   - Update name and contact information
   - Upload profile picture directly to Supabase Storage

2. **Security Management**
   - Change password with confirmation
   - Update email address

3. **Professional Information Management**
   - Update company/firm details
